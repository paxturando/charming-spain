				<p class="margen-superior texto-ancho">General Terms and Conditions between Charming-Spain.com and the user:</p>
				<h2>1. INFORMATION</h2>
				<p>You are responsible for every piece of personal information supplied to us. By sending us that information, you confirm that it is accurate and we can use it to book hotels, activities and other holiday related services for you. We guarantee that your information will only be used to book your trip; it will never be sold or traded to a third party. We are not responsible for any wrong information or expired documents given to us. The Passport or ID card must be valid for 6 months beyond the intended length of stay. It is your responsibility to carry the correct personal documents.</p>
				<h2 class="margen-superior">2. PROCESS</h2>
				<p>These are the steps to use our services:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bola-lista"></span><p>The user will fill our form with all the required information. If any of the sections are left blank, we will decide the best option to improve your holidays.</p></li>
					<li><span class="bola-lista"></span><p>We will plan your trip within 2 to 3 working days, and we will send you a detailed daily summary, with photos of the services (hotels, activities) and the total cost of your holidays, including our fee.</p></li>
					<li><span class="bola-lista"></span><p>You can accept the initial plan or otherwise request changes or modifications.</p></li>
					<li><span class="bola-lista"></span><p>If a change is requested, we would provide you a new “initial plan” with the modifications.</p></li>
					<li><span class="bola-lista"></span><p>Once you are 100% happy with your holiday plan, we will send you an online invoice with our fee (see <a href="#prices" class="animacion-scroll">prices</a> and <a href="#payment" class="animacion-scroll">payment</a>).</p></li>
					<li><span class="bola-lista"></span><p>Once the payment is done, we will book your trip. A confirmation with all the bookings, names and addresses will be sent to you. This confirmation will be called “final plan".</p></li>
				</ul>
				<a id="prices" name="prices"></a>
				<h2 class="margen-superior">3. PRICES</h2>
				<p>We will charge you a small fee for using our services. This fee will vary depending on the number of people travelling, the duration of the trip, the activities planned, etc.</p>
				<a id="payment" name="payment"></a>
				<h2 class="margen-superior">4. PAYMENT</h2>
				<p>We do not sell package holidays and therefore all the bookings must be paid directly to the providers. We will only charge you our fee. We accept all major credit and debit cards, PayPal and bank transfers.</p>
				<h2 class="margen-superior">5. REFUNDS</h2>
				<p>Due to the special nature of the website, our fee is non-refundable.</p>
				<h2 class="margen-superior">6. CHANGES</h2>
				<p>Changes can be made from the final plan, if requested, up to 7 days before the start date. Please keep in mind that we book services from other companies, so it will not always be possible to make changes. We will send you a confirmation e-mail with all the requested modifications and the modified price.</p>
				<h2 class="margen-superior">7. FLIGHTS</h2>
				<p>Please note that we will recommend the airport you should arrive to in Spain, but we will not buy or book any flight tickets, as we are not a Tour Operator.</p>
				<h2 class="margen-superior">8. TICKETS TO EVENTS</h2>
				<p>We can arrange your tickets to be collected at your hotel. If you need that service, please let us know when you confirm the initial plan.</p>
				<h2 class="margen-superior">9. ONCE YOU ARE TRAVELLING</h2>
				<p>We strongly recommend purchasing travel insurance, as Charming Spain will not be responsible for any problem of any kind that may arise while travelling, such as delays, robberies, accidents... etc.</p>
				<p>We do not provide for meals, overnight accommodation, extra transfers or any other costs resulting from such problems.</p>
				<p>We always use the most reliable companies to plan and book your trip; however we will not be responsible for any problems caused by these companies.</p>
				<p>We will not be responsible for any costs incurred by you or any member of your group during your holidays as a consequence of inappropriate conduct or insufficient travel insurance being purchased.</p>
				<p>If you need any assistance while travelling you can contact us (see <a href="contact.php">contact</a>) and one member of our team will be happy to help.</p>
				<h2 class="margen-superior">10. THE WEBSITE</h2>

We reserve the right to make changes to the website and any information it contains at any time and we make no commitment to keep the information up-to-date nor any representation or warranty as to the currency, accuracy or completeness of the information.
