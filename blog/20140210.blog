LAS FALLAS, 15-19 OF MARCH |
“Las Fallas” is an once-in-a-lifetime experience you shouldn´t miss. It is a unique festival involving fire, gunpowder and folklore. Firecrackers are thrown everywhere anytime and paellas are cooked in the middle of the streets, where the music is played night and day. The aim of the festival is to burn the “ninots”, which are huge satirical sculptures built with combustible materials. The ninots are extremely lifelike and represent popular characters in a grotesque way. Usually a “Falla” is formed by a main ninot (that can be 30 meters high!) surrounded by smaller ones, and it is made by specialized artisans throughout the entire year. |

There are more than 380 Fallas all around Valencia, and the last night all of them will be burned at the same time setting ablaze the whole city, literally.</p>
<p class="resumen-entrada-blog">Each year one of the ninots is saved by popular demand. It is exhibited in a Museum where you can find all the saved ninots, offering you a very interesting visit.</p>
<p class="resumen-entrada-blog">But the festival is not only about burning stuff; it is also about exploding stuff. Be prepared for the ground to shake with the force of the fireworks display which begins at 2pm every day, or to admire the colours and forms of the night display at 1am. You can also release that inner child and throw as many firecrackers as you want.</p>
<p class="resumen-entrada-blog">Maybe the best way to describe the Fallas is the comment of Janet Morton: "The scene at Las Fallas is extremely cathartic and difficult to describe, but resembles a cross between a bawdy Disneyland, the Fourth of July and the end of the world!"</p>
<p class="resumen-entrada-blog">There are different theories about the origin of the Fallas, but most of the people agree that all started around the 17th century, when the carpenters began to burn all the useless wooden items in honour of their patron, St Joseph. It became more popular and entire neighbourhoods joined the carpenters by making piles of old furniture and clothes. They called that a Falla. Eventually those neighbourhoods competed to get the best Falla, so they started using wooden dolls representing popular characters. That is how some fires in honour of St. Joseph have become into a five days celebration that triplicates the population of Valencia.</p>
